<h1>ðŸ¤– Santiago'sBot ðŸ¤– | My Telegram Bot</h1>
<p>With the idea of sending messages to myself from another project I worked on, I came up with the idea of creating a bot in telegram. It started as something very small, but I decided to improve it. One of its functions adapts the stock project, giving the user the possibility to select a company and get the changes in the company's stock from one day to the next, with some related news. The chatbot is still under development and I plan to keep adding more and more interesting features to it.</p>

<h2>Available Commands</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>/start</strong>: Welcomes the users and invite them to use help function</li>
<li><strong>help</strong>: Shows available commands</li>
<li><strong>roll</strong>: Allows the user to roll a die of the size of his choice</li>
<li><strong>stock</strong>: Shows the user how the shares of certain companies have changed during the day and sends news related to the changes.</li>
<li><strong>anime</strong>: Show the user an anime image</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to find the bot?</h2>
<p>You can search it on Telegram's app as it's name <strong><em>Santiago'sBot</em></strong>
